in the **RockedScience** publication on Medium. Since then,

## Description

This project shows how to build `IoT` devices for the _smart home_ using:

 * Google Cloud Platform (IoT platform, backend API, data store)
 * Google Home and Assistant (remote text and voice control)

A _virtual_ "smart plug" device simulator is also included.
The simulator demostrates how to connect to the Cloud, send and receive
data, handle reconnections, configurations and states.

Check the docs of each available component for details.

Available components:

 * [Terraform configuration](./terraform)
 * [Smart Plug Simulator](./smart-plug-simulator)
