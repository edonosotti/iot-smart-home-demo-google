# IoT Smart Home with Google Tutorial

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

This project shows how to build `IoT` devices for the _smart home_ using:

 * Google Cloud Platform (IoT platform, backend API, data store)
 * Google Home and Assistant (remote text and voice control)

A _virtual_ "smart plug" device simulator is also included.
The simulator demostrates how to connect to the Cloud, send and receive
data, handle reconnections, configurations and states.

**This project is in a very early phase.**

Check the docs of each available component for details.

Available components:

 * [Terraform configuration](./terraform)
 * [Smart Plug Simulator](./smart-plug-simulator)
